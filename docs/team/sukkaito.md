## Project: Your Mother's Favourite Cookbook (YMFC)


### Overview
Your Mother's Favourite Cookbook (YMFC) is a desktop app for managing recipes, designed for use through the
Command Line Interface (CLI). YMFC can help you manage all your recipes with ease, using the simplicity of the CLI, and
keep track of what ingredients you have on hand.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
